### Scope:
Automate the process of calculating the reimbursement amount on the FitPeo website based on multiple CPT codes.

---

### Prerequisites:
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Required to run Java-based automation scripts.
2. **IntelliJ IDEA**: Preferred for writing automation scripts (any compatible IDE can be used).
3. **Dependencies**: Include commonly used tools such as WebDrivers (e.g., Selenium, ChromeDriver).

---

### Project Setup:

1. **Install Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure all necessary tools and dependencies are installed.

2. **Create a New Java Project**:
   - Follow proper naming conventions while creating the project.

3. **Import Required Modules**:
   - Include modules such as `JavascriptExecutor`, `WebDriver`, `WebElement`, `ChromeDriver`, and interaction-related actions.

4. **Set Up WebDriver**:
   - Specify the path to the ChromeDriver (e.g., `"E:\\automation\\Chrome.WebDriver"`) and initialize the WebDriver instance.

5. **Load FitPeo Website**:
   - Open the browser and navigate to the FitPeo home page.

6. **Navigate to the Revenue Calculator**:
   - Use `driver.get()` to redirect to the home page.
   - Implement `WebDriverWait` for navigating to the "Revenue Calculator" page.
   - Use `Thread.sleep` to ensure the page fully loads before proceeding.

7. **Interact with the Slider**:
   - Scroll to the "Slider" section using `JavascriptExecutor`.
   - Adjust the slider value to `820` and validate that the associated text reflects the same.

8. **Update the Text Field**:
   - Change the text field value to `560` and ensure the slider value updates accordingly.

9. **Select CPT Codes**:
   - Scroll down and select the required checkboxes for CPT codes.

10. **Validate Results**:
    - Verify that the total recurring reimbursement amount is `$110,700`.

11. **Stop the Automation**:
    - Use `driver.quit()` to close the browser and end the automation process.

### Conclusion:
The successful completion of this automation ensures accurate and efficient calculation of reimbursement amounts on the FitPeo website, based on multiple CPT codes. By leveraging Selenium and Java, the process is streamlined, reducing manual effort and improving reliability. This solution validates key functionalities, including slider adjustments, text field updates, and CPT code selections, ensuring consistent and precise results.
